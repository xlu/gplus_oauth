This project aims to be a step-up to advance google-plus-python-starter project located at https://developers.google.com/+/downloads The project is written in rails 3.1

Note: The original intent is to obtain google+ posts. However, after getting oauth to work, I found that current google+ api only allows to retrieve posts in public domain, so it is not worthwhile for me to continue the work at this point.

Main contributions:
1) Fixed two bugs in the original google-plus-python-starter to make it actually running and return user data after oauth.
2) refactor the code
3) sinatra server is no longer needed to run this code; only rails server is needed.

app/controllers/gplus_controller.rb
  login: set up oauth process
  import: take oauth resulting code and retrieve user info
  clear_session: clear session

app/assets/stylesheets
  application.css
    add style for page title
  gplus.css.scss
    add style for viewing user gplus data

app/views/gplus
  login.html.erb
    interface for user to login
  import.html.erb
    display user info after user oauth login successful
  list.html.erb
