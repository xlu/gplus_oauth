This project aims to be a step-up to advance google-plus-python-starter project located at https://developers.google.com/+/downloads The project is written in rails 3.1

Note: The original intent is to obtain google+ posts. However, after getting oauth to work, I found that current google+ api only allows to retrieve posts in public domain, so it is not worthwhile for me to continue the work at this point.

Main contributions:
1) Fixed two bugs in the original google-plus-python-starter to make it actually running and return user data after oauth.
2) refactor the code
3) sinatra server is no longer needed to run this code; only rails server is needed.
